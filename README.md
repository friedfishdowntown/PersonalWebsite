I made this webpage totally for fun, but I still wish to put my academic information in here so that it could become an additional spotlight for my
applicaiton. I originally just wanted to initialize a website through some online website builders, but later I found out that they all charge me with
a decent about of fees to access key features. To avoid spending extra expenses (as a college student, I really don't have that much money to spend
outside than groceries and foods), I chose to learn CSS and HTML myself by finding youtube videos and ask chatGPT. Those approaches are one hundred percent
free!!! I hope my readers can offer me more advice on the format and the content of my personal website. Thank you for reading my rambleÔºÅHonestly, if you 
have the habit of skipping the readme, I would truly appreciate it.
