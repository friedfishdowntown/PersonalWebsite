      <h2>Street Fighter-Style Game (Python)</h2>
      <p>
        As the team lead for my final project in <strong>15-122: Fundamentals of Programming</strong>, I spearheaded the development of a 2D fighting game inspired by <em>Street Fighter</em>, implemented entirely in Python using the <code>cmu_graphics</code> library.
      </p>
      <p>
        I coordinated the design and division of labor within the team, managed our development timeline, and personally implemented core game features such as character movement, collision detection, hitbox logic, and animation switching. The project also involved sound integration, sprite management, and basic AI behavior for a non-player character.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project strengthened my skills in object-oriented programming, real-time input handling, and collaborative software development.

      <h2>Intro to EDIE Project</h2>
      <p>
        As part of <strong>Introduction to Engineering, Design, Innovation and Entrepreneurship</strong>, I led the development of a user-centered product aimed at improving dormitory living conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed and conducted interviews with dorm residents to understand the gap between users’ needs and the existing environment, gathered insights, and iterated the design accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I presented the final product concept to classmates, incorporating their feedback into further refinements. This experience enhanced my skills in user research, prototyping, and communicating design ideas.
